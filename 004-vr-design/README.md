# VR DESIGN - PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

## INTRODUCTION
This document describes how I develop a project named Puzzler which consist in a game where the application suggest a sequence for the player (the VR users) to follow and execute. In order for the user to win the game, the correct sequence needs to be executed.

In this document it is also described how the project was created from just the requirements to the sketches, from user test to actual final implementation. 

##ABOUT PUZZLER
At the beginning of the project the requirements were that a game based on Simon Says logic needs to be defined where the application will suggest a sequence to complete and will notify the user whether this was successfully completed or not. It will also let the user to play again if he/she chooses to. 

As part of this project, a new Unity project was created from scratch, importing only a few elements from templates and scripts.

The following link shows how the project works after the development was completed.
