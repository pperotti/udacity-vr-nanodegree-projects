In my post I decided to review 2 applications only because both are very good:

* SAMSUNG INTERNET
Brief Description
This application let the user browse the Internet from the phone while using VR Headsets. 

PROS
- The mood when you open this application set you in a comfortable, quiet place suitable for reading the news in the morning. 
- The way options are presented are well polished and simple once you get familiar with Samsung VR experience.
- You can read a regular news paper without any trouble since the experience is like being sit in front a 60 inches TV at one maybe one and a half meters.
- You can browse the web with your voice or soft keyboard presented on the screen. 

CONS
- This is only available for Samsung devices. 
- For a non-tech user, it takes about 1 minutes to understand all the options before you want to actually start reading your news paper.

* NETFLIX VR
Brief Description
Let the user watch movies inside your Samsung Gear device. 

PROS
* The experience goes along with the rest of Samsung Experience. 
* The mood is awesome. 
* Once you open Netflix, you can use it as you are in your phone / tablet or favorite device.

CONS
* Only available in Samsung.
* Netflix VR is in Play Store but only in US for Non-samsung devices.
