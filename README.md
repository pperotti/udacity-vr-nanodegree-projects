# Introduction
This repo contains all the projects created though the VR Nanodegree course.

# Nomenclature used to create new projects
The name of the directory will use the following structure: 

**[number of the class]-{name of the course}**

where: 
* number of the class: This field will use a 3 digit prefix. 
* name of the course: This field is the name of the class in lowercase letters and '-' to replace the spaces.

For example: the name for the first course is: Hello VR World, then the name of the directory is **001-hello-vr-world**
