# Overview
This project contains the files related with the second course project. 

# Time Tracking
The project was developed completely in about 6 hours. 

To perform this project I divided the development in phases:
* Adding Furniture to the appartment (1.5h)
* Adding Lights to the appartment (2h)
* Adding Globe animations (2h)
* Final Tweaks (.5h)

# Challenges
Using different lights was not as straight forward as I observed from videos. Specially tuning them for performance. On the other hand, having the globe's animation machine state properly configured differ a bit from the explanations. I finally got the problems I had working thanks to Stackoverflow forums. 

# What I liked the most
Observing the project running in different phones / viewers is rewarding.
