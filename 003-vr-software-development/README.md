# Introduction

This repo contains the final project for module 3 called "VR Development". 

The project consists on a Maze where the player has to search for a key to open the door that let him/her win the game. In the process of finding the key, the player can collect coins.

# Implementation Notes
The user can collect coins but there is no game logic in place beyond unlocking the door once the key was found.

Some ideas that can be incorportate for future versions of the projects are: 
- Collect all the coins to make the key appear.
- Once the key appears, the user has to be in front of the door to unlock it vs the current implementation which opens the door as soon as the key is found.
